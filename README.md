# gitops-acg-dive
In this project I am developing my GitOps skillset. GitOps is an approach to automating DevOps pipelines. It utilizes a version control system to create and maintain infrastructure as well as the application source code. 
I am using GitHub Actions Workflow to build and push a container to Docker Hub. The application container is then deployed to my Kubernetes Cluser through Flux. Flux is used within the GitHub environment to deploy applications into Development and Production environments and keep Kubernetes clusters synchronized with the GitHub repository.
